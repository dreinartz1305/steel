# Overview

This section aims to give an overview of the steel decarbonization model. Steel companies today provide essential products for multiple sectors and services, however, the steel sector is responsible of X% of CO2 produced globally. The purpose of this model is to simulate different pathways to decarbonize the manufacturing of steel in the fastest, and most economic way possible, taking into consideration multiple constrains, such as the location of the factories, and investment cycles.

## Scope

Short paragraph about the scope of the model and considerations

## Model concepts and flow

Outline the model flow

### Import data

Talk about where the data comes frome, how it is stored, link to the functions about data.

- Load data
- Hydrogen timeseries
- Timeseries
- Standarise business cases
- Country reference

### Data preprocessing

Small paragraph about how the data is preprocessed and the stpes taken:

- Steel plant processor
- Capex Opex data
- Preprocessed emissions data
- Emissions flow
- Capex timeseries
- Emissions calculations
